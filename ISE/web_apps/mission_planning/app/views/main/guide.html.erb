size="6">Understanding SATRN</font></h2>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The Situational Awareness
Tactical Response Network (SATRN) is an
operator-in-the-loop training environment which enables
both our Department of Defense (DoD) stakeholders and
industry to measure and adjust Tactics, Techniques &
Procedures (TTP) to ensure the warfighter gets the most
effective and reliable tools in the field. It also allows
force-effectiveness analysis for differing weapons systems
as well as the Threat Evaluation and Weapon Assignment
(TEWA) algorithms that are employed to manage the
battlespace. Finally SATRN provides an end-to-end
environment for best-of-breed product testing. This allows
Lockheed Martin Missiles & Fire Control (MFC) to set up
conditions as they would appear in the field and introduce
small, incremental changes to show rapid deployment
solutions to today's issues.</p>

<p><font color="#4f81bd"><font face=
"Cambria, serif"><i>Launchers<a name=
"Launchers"></a></i></font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Now that the interceptor(s)
are created the launchers are next. Like the interceptors,
there are default values for the PAC-3, GEM-T, and THAAD
launchers. In this section there has to be a type of
interceptor selected for the specific launcher desired and
that is accomplished from the Interceptor drop down box. In
addition to the type of interceptor the number of
interceptors is determined through the Interceptor qty
(quantity) field. Then the doctrine is also to be
determined by the user.</p>

<p style="line-height: 115%;"><font color="#4f81bd"><font
face="Cambria, serif"><i>Batteries<a name=
"Launchers"></a></i></font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">So after the launcher has
been saved the batteries must be created and/ or edited.
The default batteries are the Patriot battery and the THAAD
battery. Only real option here is for the user to determine
which launchers are in the particular battery that they
desire, this is done by clicking View Launchers on the page
and selecting which launchers will be in the battery and
the number of launchers to be inside the launcher. After
the behind the scenes information is set, the next step is
the scenario.</p>

<p><font color="#4f81bd"><font face=
"Cambria, serif"><i>Scenario<a name=
"Scenario"></a></i></font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Begin the scenario here:
blue-force laydown, threat generation, and tewa
configurations. First, starting off with the naming of the
scenario (which is a required field, as indicated by the
(*). The desc or
description field is open to the use at the discretion of
the user. The Integrated Defense Planner (IDP) file path
field is used to direct the file to the appropriate XML
file from the IDP software and begins with
I:\. The Scene Generator
(SG) file path field is similar in the way that it is
contains the file path for the root directory that contains
the information provided by the Scene Generator
software.</p>

<p><font color="#4f81bd"><font face="Cambria, serif"><i>IDP
Enhancements<a name=
"IDP Enhancements"></a></i></font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The IDP Enhancement drop
down box is composed of certain IDP Enhancements, which are
identified by name). The IDP Enhancements contains
information about the Battery selected and the IDP DA
(Defended Area). The name for the Batteries and DAs are
predetermined. The IDP Battery names are determined by the
user from the IDP, while the Battery Definition is
preselected but the user has the option to go into the
Configuration menu and add and/or delete battery
definitions to be selected. The battery definitions
essentially set up the information that is to be filled in
by the user due to the fact IDP doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t
provide that info, so therefore this feature allows the
user to enhance the information from the IDP. The DAs are
preset due to the IDP. If it is the
user&acirc;&euro;&trade;s desire they may create and/or
destroy the IDP Enhancements that are available. The
relative importance values remain to be set by the user,
note: this IDP DA value is ranked valued between 0-100,
where the sum of the values must equal 100 (for example if
there are only two areas to defend, if DA1 is 75 then DA2
has to be 25).</p>

<p><font color="#4f81bd"><font face=
"Cambria, serif"><i>TEWA Configuration<a name=
"TEWA Configuration"></a></i></font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The next drop down box on
the Scenario page is TEWA Configuration, which is composed
of the View Threat Type Weights, View Threat Priority
Factor Weights and View Weapon Bidding Factor Weights
sections and a doctrine button. After naming the TEWA
configuration select the doctrine button IF there is a need
to implement doctrine for this scenario. Use the View
Threat Type Weights section to set the relative importance
for each type of threat, ranking the importance from 0-100,
just like the IDP DA. Use the View Threat Priority Factor
Weights section to set which aspect of the threat is most
important relative to each other on the 0-100 ranking.
Finally after creating those weights then use the View
Weapon Bidding Factor Weights to set the importance of the
various aspects of the weapon to be used to handle the
threat on a 0-100 value as before. After all of the fields
are accounted for the there is an option to either save the
scenario till later or save and run the scenario.</p>

<h2 class="western">Launch<a name="Launch"></a></h2>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Select a pre-define scenario
and hit go. This is where the action begins. So Step 1
indicates that the Scenario is ready to be validated and
checked. (The scenario can also be changed at this moment
by the drop down box.) So after checking the scenario with
the Check Scenario button and it showing a status of pass,
then Step 2 is to prepare the simulation to be ran in the
Engagement Manager. Proceed to step 3 in order to launch
the Engagement Manager in the Advanced Air Defense
Synthetic Environment (AADSE). The Launch Eng Manager link
opens up the AADSE Dashboard Engagement Manager. To
understand the AADSE, refer to the Synthetic Environment
Users Guide.</p>

<h2 class="western">Review<a name="Review"></a></h2>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Analyze the effectiveness of
the selected operator, weapon systems, and TEWA algorithm
from the specified scenario run. The main focus is the
Force Effectiveness rating. The high the rating the better
the system.</p>
