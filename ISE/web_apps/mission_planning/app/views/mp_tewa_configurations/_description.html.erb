WARNING:
<ul>
  <li>This web application has a software defect which may result in user edits being ignored without warning.
  This condition is caused by user inputs outside of their valid range.  No TEWA value can be greater than 100 or
  less than zero.  The scenario name is another area that can generate errors.  The scenario name must be all lowercase
  characters (letters or numbers).  You may use the underscore character (_) to separate words.  No upper case letters,
  spaces or other special characters are allowed in the scenario name.  The scenario name must also be unique.  You may
  not add a new scenario with a name that is the same as an existing TEWA scenario.
  When this condition occurs, do the following to recover:
  <ul>
    <li>press your web browser's "back" button to return to the edit page
    <li>check your inputs to ensure that no value is outside of its valid range
    <li>press the "Update TEWA Configuration" button.
  </ul>
</ul>
We apologize for the inconvenience.  The TEWA area of the Mission Planning web application is under
development.  Future releases will not have this problem.
